# Favourite programming languages: a hacktober project

In honour of Hacktoberfest, I am doing a collaborative project that looks at everyone's **favourite programming languages** from around the world.

To participate, please create a json file with your first and last name in camelCase (e.g., johnSmith.json). Then copy and paste the [template.json](template.json) content into your json and add the appropriate information. You can only add 1 favourite programming language. FYI - *native language* in the template json refers to *spoken language*, sorry about the confusion. Take a look at the example entry [data/jillCates.json](data/jillCates.json) as a guideline.

Once enough data is collected, I'll share visualizations of the data with you all.
